# Homework #6
### tasks

* Given an array of numbers. Write a function to separate odd and even numbers in different arrays.
* Given a phone number. Write a function to clean it up, so it is valid. The rules are as follows:
If the phone numberis less than 10 digits assume that it is a bad number
If the phone numberis longerthan 10, then it is a bad number
If the phone numberis 10 digits assume that it is good
If the phone number consists of 11 symbols and the first one is + and others are numbers, then trim +
and return remaining 10 digits.
If the phone number contains + symbol more than one, considerit as a bad number.
If the phone number contains + symbol not as the first character, considerit as a badnumber.
* Given a word and a list of possible anagrams, select the correct sublist.
* Write a function, which receives a string, finds possible largest numbers in the string and returns their
sum.
* Write a function which receives two strings and removes appearances of the second string from the first
one.
* Write a function to compute a new string from the given one by moving the first charto come afterthe
next two chars, so "abc" yields "bca". Repeat this process for each subsequent group of 3 chars. Ignore
any group of fewerthan 3 chars at the end.
